When I left Peru for university back in 2022, I gradually abandoned my Mandarin study habits. Even though I had Mandarin classes at school, I couldn't keep myself motivated to keep up with the grueling grind that is studying a foreign language. Looking back, my tracking system wasn't strong enough and I didn't have many sources of motivation. I've always wanted to have a blog where I could keep a backlog of my progress, so here it is! I really hope this can keep me on track this time.

What you can see below is a small visualization that I made with CalHeatmap and the database for my anki collection so I can have some public, quantitative display of how I'm holding up. The data is fed through a Raspberry Pi 3 that I had lying around to a git submodule in the website's repo. I also added vim motions to the website since I'm already so used to them and vimium doesn't work on locally hosted websites.

I'll try and update the blog every few weeks with progress, but in case I don't, you can see my progress here! See ya around!
