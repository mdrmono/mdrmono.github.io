      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I left Peru for university back in 2022, I gradually abandoned my Mandarin study habits. Even though I had Mandarin classes at school, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t keep myself motivated to keep up with the grueling grind that is studying a foreign language. Looking back, my tracking system wasn&amp;rsquo;t strong enough and I didn&amp;rsquo;t have many sources of motivation. I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to have a blog where I could keep a backlog of my progress, so here it is! I really hope this can keep me on track this time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
